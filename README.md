# VISUALIZATION OF THE GLOBAL GENOME STRUCTURE

The 1000 Genomes Project is the most detailed catalogue of human genetic variation from at least one thousand anonymous individuals from different ethnic groups. It was an international research effort using newly developed technologies which were faster and less expensive. Until now, the research communities have extensively used the reference data resources generated from this project. Although human beings are 99.9% identical, the 0.1% difference holds important clues about the diversity of the genome and the causes of diseases. Hence, understanding the genome diversity in different populations is crucial.

In this project, the samples from four different continents (Asia, Africa, Europe, and America) in the 1000 genomes database were analysed using their chromosome 1 data. The objective was to investigate and depict (using graphs) the diversity of the world's genome and show why there is a need for more inclusion in sequencing projects.
