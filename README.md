# VISUALIZATION OF THE GLOBAL GENOME STRUCTURE


In this project, the samples from four different continents (Asia, Africa, Europe, and America) in the 1000 genomes database were analysed using their chromosome 1 data.

### OBJECTIVES

•	To investigate correlations between the genomic data points of the populations from the 4 continents (Africa, America, Asia and Europe).

•	To generate a low dimensional representation of the genomic data of the 4 continents using PCA in order to preserve as much information as possible (maximizing variance)

•	To depict (using graphs) the diversity of the world's genome and show why there is a need for more inclusion in sequencing projects.
